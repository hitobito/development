# Hitobito Development üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª

We're glad you want to setup your machine for Hitobito development üíÉ

## System Requirements

You need to have [Docker][docker] and _[docker-compose][doco]_ installed on your computer.
The free _Docker Community Edition (CE)_ works perfectly fine. Make sure your user is part of the docker group:
```bash
usermod -a -G docker $MY_USER
```

[docker]: https://docs.docker.com/install/
[doco]: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Additionally you need **git** to be installed and configured.
 
 ‚ö° This manual focuses on Linux/Ubuntu. Hitobito development also runs on other plattforms with some adjustments. 

## Preparation

First declare a instance name: (e.g. generic, pbs)

```bash
read -p "Enter hitobito instance name: " INSTANCE_NAME
```

Then you need to clone this repository:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/git/hitobito && cd ~/git/hitobito
git clone https://github.com/hitobito/development.git $INSTANCE_NAME && cd $INSTANCE_NAME
(cd app && git clone https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito.git)
```

Now you need to add at least one wagon project:

```bash
# wagon project(s)
(cd app && git clone https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito_generic.git)
```

The final structure in app/ should look something like this:

```bash
$ ls -lah app/
total 16K
drwxrwxr-x  4 ps ps 4.0K Jun 25 11:20 .
drwxrwxr-x 17 ps ps 4.0K Jun 25 10:00 ..
drwxrwxr-x 18 ps ps 4.0K Jun 25 07:29 hitobito
drwxrwxr-x 11 ps ps 4.0K Jun 24 10:53 hitobito_generic
```

## Install Gems / Setup Database

If you did not so before, create new docker volumes for storing bundled gems and yarn packages:

```bash
docker volume create hitobito_bundle
docker volume create hitobito_yarn_cache
```

‚ö° If your user id is not 1000 (run id -u to check), you need to export this as env variable: **export UID=$UID** before running any of the further commands. Maybe you want to add this to your bashrc. 

Now it's time to seed the database with development seeds:

```bash
docker-compose run rails 'rails db:seed wagon:seed'
```

‚ö° This will also install all required gems which takes some time to complete if it's executed the first time.

## Start Development Containers

To start the Hitobito application, run the following command in your shell:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

After this command completed, make sure all services are up and running:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

This should look something like this:

```
          Name                         Command               State                 Ports               
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

development_worker_1        rails-entrypoint rails job ...   Up      8080/tcp
```

Access webapplication by browser: http://localhost:3000 and log in using *hitobito@puzzle.ch* and password *hito42bito*. For some wagons, the e-mail address is different. Go to the file ```/config/settings.yml``` inside your wagon repository and look out for the field "root_email". Use this e-mail address to login.

## Emails sent by hitobito

:email: When you someone requests a password reset or registers for an event, an email is usually sent out from hitobito to that user. In your local hitobito, these emails are not really sent to the real recipients, but instead all end up in **mailcatcher**. You can access these emails by visiting http://localhost:1080 in your browser.

## Development

Start developing by editing files locally with your prefered editor in the app/hitobito* folders. Those directories are mounted inside the containers. So every saved file is instantly available inside the containers. 

### Running rails tasks, console

For executing tasks like **rails routes** or starting the rails console in **development** environment, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose exec rails bash
```

For executing tests or running other commands in **test** environment, do the same for the rails-test container:

```bash
docker-compose exec rails-test bash
```

### HTTP request debugging with pry

For debugging with pry during a HTTP request, you can attach to the running docker container:

```bash
docker attach $(docker-compose ps | grep _rails_1 | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
```

For detaching after debugging, you use CTRL+p followed by CTRL+q

### Shutdown

üç∫ finished work ? execute **docker-compose down** to shut down all running containers

### Updating Images

:calendar: If you have installed a previous development setup before 03.2021, please run the following command inside one project, and then update your images:
```bash
docker-compose down && docker volume rm hitobito_bundle && docker volume create hitobito_bundle
```


When the images of this project change, execute the following command to update them locally:

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```
