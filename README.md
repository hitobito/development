# Hitobito Development üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª

We're glad you want to setup your machine for hitobito development üíÉ

## System Requirements

You need to have [Docker][docker] and _[docker-compose][doco]_ installed on your computer.
The free _Docker Community Edition (CE)_ works perfectly fine. Make sure your user is part of the docker group:
```bash
usermod -a -G docker $USER
```

[docker]: https://docs.docker.com/install/
[doco]: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Additionally you need **git** to be installed and configured.
 
 üêß This manual focuses on Linux/Ubuntu. Hitobito development also runs on other plattforms with some adjustments. 

## Quick start

You can straight go ahead and clone your hitobito dev setup by taking full advantage of the `hitobito_clone` script located within `bin/hitobito_clone.rb`

Make sure you execute the script in the folder you want to have your hitobito setup.

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hitobito/development/master/bin/hitobito_clone.rb | ruby
```

&ast;Note: by adding the -h option, you get some good information about what the script is able to do further.

## Preparation

First declare a instance name: (e.g. generic, pbs)

```bash
read -p "Enter hitobito instance name: " INSTANCE_NAME
```

Then you need to clone this repository:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/git/hitobito && cd ~/git/hitobito
git clone https://github.com/hitobito/development.git $INSTANCE_NAME && cd $INSTANCE_NAME
(cd app && git clone https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito.git)
```

Now you need to add at least one wagon project:

```bash
# wagon project(s)
(cd app && git clone https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito_generic.git)
```

‚ö° If you like to contribute to an existing wagon/organisation please adapt this e.g. `(cd app && git clone https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito_youth.git && git clone https://github.com/hitobito/hitobito_pbs.git)`


The final structure in app/ should look something like this:

```bash
$ ls -lah app/
total 16K
drwxrwxr-x  4 ps ps 4.0K Jun 25 11:20 .
drwxrwxr-x 17 ps ps 4.0K Jun 25 10:00 ..
-rw-r--r-x  1 ps ps    2 Jun 25 10:00 .gitignore
-rw-r--r-x  1 ps ps  226 Jun 25 10:00 Wagonfile.dev
drwxrwxr-x 18 ps ps 4.0K Jun 25 07:29 hitobito
drwxrwxr-x 11 ps ps 4.0K Jun 24 10:53 hitobito_generic
```

## Prepare storage space for dependencies

If you did not so before, create new docker volumes for storing bundled gems and yarn packages:

```bash
docker volume create hitobito_bundle
docker volume create hitobito_yarn_cache
```

‚ö° If your user id is not 1000 (run id -u to check), you need to export this as env variable: **export RAILS_UID=$UID** before running any of the further commands. Maybe you want to add this to your bashrc.

## Start Development Containers

To start the Hitobito application, run the following command in your shell:

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

‚ö° This will also install all required gems and seed the database, which takes some time to complete if it's executed the first time. You can follow the progress using `docker-compose logs --follow rails` (exit with Ctrl+C).

After the startup has completed (once you see `Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000` in the logs), make sure all services are up and running:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

This should look something like this:

```
          Name                         Command               State                 Ports               
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

development_mailcatcher_1   container-entrypoint mailc ...   Up      0.0.0.0:1080->1080/tcp, 8080/tcp

development_sphinx_1        sphinx-start                     Up      36307/tcp                         
development_worker_1        rails-entrypoint rails job ...   Up      8080/tcp
```

Access the web application by browser: http://localhost:3000 and log in using *hitobito@puzzle.ch* and password *hito42bito*. For some wagons, the e-mail address is different. Go to the file ```/config/settings.yml``` inside your wagon repository and look out for the field "root_email". Use this e-mail address to login.

## E-Mails

:email: All mails sent by your local development environment end up in **mailcatcher**. You can access these e-mails by visiting http://localhost:1080.

## Development

Start developing by editing files locally with your prefered editor in the app/hitobito* folders. Those directories are mounted inside the containers. So every saved file is instantly available inside the containers.

:bulb: If you don't know where to begin changing something, have a look at our hitobito cheatsheet in [English](./doc/hitobito-cheatsheet-en.pdf) and [German](./doc/hitobito-cheatsheet.pdf).

### Running rails tasks, console

For executing tasks like **rails routes** or starting the rails console in **development** environment, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose exec rails bash
```

### Running tests

To run the core tests:
```bash
# Open a testing console in the container
docker-compose exec -e RAILS_ENV=test rails bash
# Run all the specs
rspec
# Run specs from a single file
rspec spec/models/person_spec.rb
```


To run the wagon tests of a specific wagon MYWAGON:
```bash
# Open a testing console in the container
docker-compose exec -e RAILS_ENV=test rails bash
# Change to the wagon directory
cd ../hitobito_MYWAGON
# Initialize the DB for the wagon tests
bundle exec rails db:test:prepare
# Run all the specs
rspec
# Run specs from a single file
rspec spec/models/person_spec.rb
```

### HTTP request debugging with pry

For debugging with pry during a HTTP request, you can attach to the running docker container:

```bash
docker attach $(docker-compose ps -q rails)
```

For detaching after debugging, you use CTRL+p followed by CTRL+q

### Access Development Database
```bash
docker-compose exec db mysql hitobito_development -uroot -phitobito
```
### Shutdown

üç∫ finished work ? execute **docker-compose down** to shut down all running containers

### Updating Images

:calendar: If you have installed a previous development setup before 03.2021, please run the following command inside one project, and then update your images:
```bash
docker-compose down && docker volume rm hitobito_bundle && docker volume create hitobito_bundle
```

When the images of this project change, execute the following command to update them locally:

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```
